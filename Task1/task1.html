                        “for all of the toxicity and pollution associated with plastic, it is difficult to imagine living without it”, writes

                        Science’s internationalism is well recognized. But scientists tend to regard it as a recent phenomenon that arose from
                        the ‘big science’ of the twentieth century, rather than one with a history of more than 500 years going back to the
                        Islamic science that inspired astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, and beyond, observes historian James Poskett. His
                        revisionary “global history” boldly rebuts this: “The myth that modern science was invented in Europe is not only false,
                        it is also deeply damaging.”

            <h3>The Monster’s Bones. David K. Randall W. W. Norton (2022)</h3>
            <p>A monstrous, 66-million-year-old fossil of Tyrannosaurus rex symbolizes the American Museum of Natural History in New
            York City, much as the Rosetta Stone does the British Museum in London. But few know how it was found. Journalist David
            Randall’s entertaining book focuses on an intrepid fossil hunter backed by a privileged socialite, and includes robber
            barons, eugenicists and cowboys.</p>
